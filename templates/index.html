            <p style="margin-left: 45px;">Ladies and gentlemen, by way of introduction, this is a site about preferences, taste, about bias.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 45px;">Tell it by the fire side or in the market or in a movie, almost every list of favorites is almost certainly some kind of lie. But not this time. No, this is a promess: for your time in here, every thing you read is really subjective, and based only on my own preferences.</p>
